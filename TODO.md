does the waiting in the playback thread affect sync?


- test over wifi
- need playing confirm?
- what other cues?

/
- cron ifup in case of wifi?
- need human procedures! what to do if things go down, etc.


### notes
- remember that controller might have a different IP if being connected to via wifi as opposed to ethernet
- this really depends on ntp. raspis stay together, OS X on a different trip.


with a syncbox on wifi, sync is noticably worse. why?
