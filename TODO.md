alsamixer needs to survive reboot
img burn
check long duration sync
review wifi
load all cues


### notes
- remember that controller might have a different IP if being connected to via wifi as opposed to ethernet
- this really depends on ntp. raspis stay together, OS X on a different trip.


with a syncbox on wifi, sync is noticably worse. why?
